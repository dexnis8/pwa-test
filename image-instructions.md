# Image Instructions

## Required Images

You need to add the following images to your project:

### 1. Onboarding Illustration

For the OnBoarding screen, you need the illustration from the design:

- Save the illustration as `get-started.png`
- Place it in the `public/images/` folder

### 2. Question Mark Logo

For the SplashScreen, you need the question mark logo:

- Save the question mark logo as `logo-question.png`
- This should be the white question mark icon in a semi-transparent rounded square
- Place it in the `public/images/` folder
- Ideal dimensions: 80x80px with transparent background

## Directory Setup

Make sure to create the images directory:

```
project-root/
└── public/
    └── images/
        ├── get-started.png
        └── logo-question.png
```

## Extracting Images

If you can't extract the exact images from the design, you can use similar alternatives that match the style of the application.
